# AI in Art - Proof of Concept (PoC)

## Overview
This repository contains a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for AI applications in art, developed by **Mike Niner Bravog**. The PoC demonstrates:

1. **AI-Generated Visual Art:** Creating abstract digital art using geometric patterns.
2. **AI-Composed Music:** Generating simple melodies with notes and chords using *music21*.
3. **Creative Chatbot:** A chatbot that answers basic questions about AI in art (expandable into a fully autonomous assistant).

## Installation
To run this PoC locally, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pillow music21
```

## Running the Code
Execute the Python script to generate visual art, compose a simple melody, and interact with the chatbot:

```bash
python ai_art_poc.py
```

## Google Colab
The code is also available as a **Google Colab Notebook** for easy execution without local setup:
